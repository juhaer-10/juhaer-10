## 🌟 About Me

I’m a passionate and self-driven **CSE student** who loves building things that make a difference.  
I focus on creating **efficient**, **scalable**, and **user-friendly** software solutions — from web applications to mobile apps and small-scale game projects.

My interests lie in:
- Backend Development with **Node.js** and RESTful APIs  
- Frontend Development using **HTML, CSS, and PHP**  
- Cross-platform Mobile App Development with **Flutter**  
- Exploring **Game Development** with Unity  
- Understanding how systems, networks, and architectures come together to build robust applications  

I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, learning new tools, and contributing to meaningful projects.
